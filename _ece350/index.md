This lab is meant to be a supplement to your ECE350 class. It will provide you with a way to explore the concepts and techniques discussed in class in a more hands on way. In order to do this, we will be using [GNU Radio Companion](https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/GNURadioCompanion), a graphical tool used to create and execute signal processing flowgraphs for Software Defined Radio. This is a very useful tool not only for demonstrating existing communication methods, but also for experimenting and developing new methods. It is heavily used both in the academic and professional worlds. For more information on Software Defined Radio, have a look at [this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_radio), or speak to your professor or TA.

This lab manual will regularly refer to the course textbook, available for free [here](../_docs/pdriessen_textbook.pdf).

### Deliverables

The lab component of this course consists of two introductory GNU Radio tutorials:

- Using GNU Radio Companion
- Variables and Controls

as well as four laboratories:

- Lab 1 - AM signals.
- Lab 2 - [USRP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Software_Radio_Peripheral) tutorials and SSB signals.
- Lab 3 - Finding frame synchronization on the [FLEX](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLEX_(protocol)>) pager network using the USRP and GNU Radio.
- Lab 4 - Pulse shaping and PSK.
- Optional activity:
  - Pass the amateur radio basic and advanced exams (contact Dr. Driessen).
  - Decoding off-air signals not covered in the other lab activities.

The deliverables are described at the beginning of each section.
