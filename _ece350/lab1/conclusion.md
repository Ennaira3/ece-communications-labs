In this lab you built both an AM modulator and demodulator. You tested it on simulated signals then demodulated an audio file.

## Deliverables

- 4 GRC files:
  - a waveform builder (`waveform-builder.grc`)
  - an AM modulator/transmitter (`AM_modulator.grc`)
  - a real AM demodulator/receiver (`AM_demodulator.grc`)
  - a complex AM demodulator/receiver (`AM_demodulator_complex.grc`)
- The written answers to the questions posed throughout the lab.
  - There are 3 questions which are all carefully labelled **Deliverable Question X**. Each question should take only one to two sentences to answer and address the concepts being explored.

If you are unsure how to submit the deliverables, ask your TA.
