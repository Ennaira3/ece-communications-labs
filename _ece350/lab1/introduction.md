**This lab relies on a basic understanding of GNU Radio. It is strongly suggested to step through the [two available tutorials]({{site.baseurl}}{% link _GRC-tutorials/introduction.md %}) before beginning this lab (_they don't take long_).**

This lab focuses on AM modulation/demodulation, both using real and complex signals.

As you work through the material, try to keep these following questions in mind:

- How is an AM signal demodulated into an audio signal?
- What methods are used to tune to a desired signal?

To understand how demodulation techniques work, please review the theory of [AM signals](../../_docs/pdriessen_textbook.pdf) (chapters 2 and 3). More specific readings are assigned through the lab.

## Deliverables

- 4 GRC files:
  - a waveform builder
  - an AM modulator
  - an AM demodulator
  - a complex AM demodulator
- A single page with answers to the three questions posed throughout the lab.
  - There are three questions which are all carefully labelled **Deliverable Question X**. Each question should take only one to two sentences to answer and address the concepts being explored.

There are also a number of questions included within the text which are not denoted "deliverable". Written answers to these questions are not required, but an effort should be made to think about and answer these questions as they are encountered.
