In this lab you will:

- learn about eye diagrams, and build a heirarchal GR block to better visualize eye diagrams,
- learn several pulse shaping techniques, and apply them to a simulated PSK system,
- practice finding synchronization keywords in a FLEX data stream.
  - this part will include writing your own script in a programming language of your choice

At the end of the lab you will also be asked to evaluate your TA. The evaluations are anonymous.

## Deliverables

- A script written in the programming language of your choice which extracts sync words from a provided file.
- A single page with answers to the questions posed throughout the lab.
  - There are several questions which are all carefully labelled **Deliverable Question X**. Each question should take only one to two sentences to answer and address the concepts being explored.

There are also a number of questions included within the text which are not denoted "deliverable". Written answers to these questions are not required, but an effort should be made to think about and answer these questions as they are encountered
