In this lab, you used GNU Radio to test several different binary phase shift keying methods. You recorded BER values for each and wrote a short script to turn them into a $$BER-\frac{E_b}{N_0}$$ curve.

## Deliverables

In this lab there are the following deliverables:

- a single page of answers to the deliverable questions laid out in the lab. In this lab there are 6 of them. They are all highlighted and labelled with their respective question numbers. Each question (hopefully) required some thought and was answered concisely with 1 to 2 sentences of text and perhaps an accompanying figure.
- a short code you wrote to generate a $$BER-\frac{E_b}{N_0}$$ curve
- your final $$BER-\frac{E_b}{N_0}$$ curve figure

Submit these three deliverables to your TA over coursespaces.
