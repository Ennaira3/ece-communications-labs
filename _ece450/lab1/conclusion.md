In this lab, you:

- used GNU Radio to build a baseband communication system,
- made a histogram of the noisy received bits and related that the the bit error values,
- recorded BER values for several $$\sigma$$ values,
- wrote a short script to turn them into $$BER versus \sigma$$ and $$BER versus \frac{a_1-a_2}{2\sigma}$$ curve.

## Deliverables

In this lab there are the following deliverables:

- a single page of answers to the deliverable questions laid out in the lab. In this lab there are 4 of them. They are all highlighted and labelled with their respective question numbers. Each question (hopefully) required some thought and was answered concisely with 1 to 2 sentences of text and perhaps an accompanying figure,
- a short code you wrote to generate the BER curves curves,
- your final BER curve figures.

Submit these three deliverables to your TA over coursespaces.

## Optional

Repeat the experiment where $$P(s_1) \neq 0.5$$ and find the threshold value that yields the minimum BER (see Sklar problem 3.6).
